This project is an analysis of the housing prices dataset from StatLib repository. This data is based on data from 1990 California census. And the analysis will display the main steps of a Machine learning project as follows.

1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine tune the model
7. Present the silutions
8. Launch, Monitor and maintain the system.
